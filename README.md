## :mega: Prerequisites

To participate in the workshop you need a GitHub account and need to be invited to the workshop organization [advanced-security](https://github.com/advanced-security). If your repository hasn't been created in the organization by the AdvSec services team, there are two ways to push a copy of this repository:

1. Create a new repository and push a copy of the `octo-gallery` repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/advanced-security/octo-gallery.git
cd octo-gallery
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/advanced-security/<your project>.git
```

2. Use the template functionality to create a new repository from `octo-gallery`.

```

```
